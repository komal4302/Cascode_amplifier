# EE301 Analog Circuits Course Project

## Project Title
**Design of Beta Multiplier, Cascode Current Mirror, and Cascode Amplifier in 22nm (0.8 V Supply) and 180nm (1.8 V Supply) Technologies**

## Project Description
This project involves the design and analysis of three fundamental analog circuit blocks:
1. **Beta Multiplier Circuit**
2. **Cascode Current Mirror**
3. **Cascode Amplifier**

The circuits were designed and implemented using two different CMOS technologies:
- **180nm technology** with a supply voltage of 1.8 V
- **22nm technology** with a supply voltage of 0.8 V

The goal was to achieve specified design parameters, including required gain, bandwidth, power dissipation, and proper biasing.

## Key Features
- **DC Analysis**:
  - Verified DC offset, output voltage swing, and input signal voltage.
- **AC Analysis**:
  - Analyzed frequency response, gain, and bandwidth.
- **Low Power Consumption**:
  - Ensured power dissipation remained under 5 mW in both technologies.

## Design Procedures
The project followed a structured design methodology:
1. Each circuit was designed individually, ensuring all MOSFETs operated in the saturation region.
2. Bias voltages were calculated and fine-tuned to meet performance requirements.
3. The circuits were cascaded and tested to ensure proper integration without undesirable cascading effects.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Simulation Tools**:
  - MAGIC layout for CMOS designs.
  - .spice simulations for DC and AC analysis.
- **Technology Specifications**:
  - 180nm technology: `VDD = 1.8 V`
  - 22nm technology: `VDD = 0.8 V`
